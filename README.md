IRemember
=========

The iRemember Windows 8.1 app store app focuses on the importance of ease of use. The app allows the user to take a picture with his/her Windows 8.1 tablet. After taking a picture, the user will be prompted to add a name, and a brief description or story to the picture. The application will automatically save the location of where the photograph is taken.

If the user opens the app on a later date, all the pictures will be visible as small dots (memories) on a world map. These dots are tappable and show the name and story of the picture when tapped. This enables the users of the iRemember app to build a diary with pictures stories and locations, all within a single app.
The app will also remind the user of an old memory (picture) when it notices the user is in short range of an old memory location. And will show the user that specific picture with the related story.
